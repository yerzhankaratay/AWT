My name is Yerzhan and I come from Kazakhstan.

I got introduced to data analysis when I studied at Vietnamese-German University and got fascinated by being able to delve in and study any topic profoundly. So I took multiple online courses during my studies and after graduation I started a data science training at Practicum by Yandex. Soon after graduation, I became its ambassador and one of the admins of the graduate community.

Being a fluent speaker of several languages I have an interest in Natural Language Processing (NLP). I listen to SuperDataScience podcasts, read their newsletters, take online courses, read books and Kaggle notebooks, work on my DS projects, and I blog here.

As for my other interests, I read a video game magazine called [Igromania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igromania) when I was a teen, and I've been following game industry news cause I am a gamer since I was 6, I play badminton and I watch professional matches from time to time, I also try to reduce my ecological footprint as I learn and share how to find balance with nature in my Russian language blog called [За балансом](https://yerkar.com) (After Balance).
